iMatt Theme - Change Log
---------------------------

1.1 - 25 Aug 2011
- Add entry form for embedding image and others from e.g. Flickr, Multiply, Pinterest
- The embed code is stored as meta of post with key name 'image'
- This meta is called before every post rendering in `index.php` and `single.php`
- Change header.php to have blog name instead of URL
